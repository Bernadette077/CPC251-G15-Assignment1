# Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing neural network using low-level TensorFlow programming (without Keras) and training it via the gradient descent algorithm. 

The primary objective is to learn the fundamentals of TensorFlow operations and core concepts in machine learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements

1. **Build a Neural Network:**

   Create neural network with single-hidden layer using the ReLU activation function

2. **Dataset Handling:**

   Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%)and test (20%) set

3. **Gradient Descent Training:**

   Implement gradient descent to estimate the weights and biases of the model

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   Assess the model performance using
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
  
5. **Loss Visualization**

   - Training Loss per epoch
   - Validation Loss per epoch
