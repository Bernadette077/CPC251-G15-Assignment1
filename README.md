# Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing neural network using low-level TensorFlow programming (without Keras) and training it via the gradient descent algorithm. We are using the `classification_dataset.csv` for this project.

The primary objective is to learn the fundamentals of TensorFlow operations and core concepts in machine learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements

1. **Build a Neural Network:**

   Create neural network with single-hidden layer using the ReLU activation function

2. **Dataset Handling:**

   Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%)and test (20%) set

3. **Gradient Descent Training:**

   Implement gradient descent to estimate the weights and biases of the model

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   Assess the model performance using
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
  
5. **Loss Visualization**

   - Training Loss per epoch
   - Validation Loss per epoch

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Process 

### 1. **Importing Libraries and Load the dataset**

   Import libraries for data handling, visualization and machine learning. 
   - `TensorFlow`: Used for building and training deep neural network machine learning model
   - `NumPy`: Used for numerical computing for multi-dimentisonal array
   - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis of tabular data
   - `Matplotlib`: Data visualization library for creating graphs, chart and plots
   - `Scikit-Learn`: Use `train_test_split` for data splitting and `classification_report` for classification metrics (precision, recall, f1-score)."
   
   Fixed random seed is set
   - Ensure sequence of random number generated is consistent
   - Making experiment result reproducible, allowing you to get the same results.
